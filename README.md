# Simulation of Relapse Counts in Context of Pregnancy in RR MS
Simulation of the relapse counts during the pre-conception year, pregnancy and year post-partum in untreated RRMS

## Goal(s)
In this project I want to create a simulation of the counts on relaspes in context of pregnancy in RRMS.
At first, I'd like to base it roughly on the PRIMS data.
Later on I want to include clinical data.
As an endpoint, I'd like to simulate different treatment effects, too. However, first the initial simualtion has to work :)
